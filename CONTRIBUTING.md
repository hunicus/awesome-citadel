## Contributing Guidelines

This collection is meant to list resources that help people reject subservience and adopt sovereignty.

To that end, please keep the following in mind:
- if a resource won't help make people more self-sufficient, it's not a good fit for this list, no matter how great the resource is on its own.
- resources with their own dependencies are generally avoided (e.g. those owned or operated by big companies, those that rely on closed-source code, etc).
